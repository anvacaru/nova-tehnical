This project aims to create an immersive audiovisual experience by integrating photography, voice recording, and projection in a theatrical setting. The experience allows audiences to feel as though they're present in several places at once.

## Image Processing

The image processing part of the project involves the following steps:

1. **Photographing Participants**: The audience members are photographed in a booth in several postures. These images are then processed and sent to the main stage for projection.

2. **Image Processing Script**: We use a script (e.g., Adobe Photoshop scripting) that automates the process of masking the audience's photos and inserting them into digital backgrounds prepared by our photo artists. The script creates multiple variations in how the digital bodies are inserted into these backgrounds, providing a unique experience for each participant.

## Audio Processing

Using Audacity scripting, the tool should be able to take several files representing audio lines and insert them at predefined timestamps in another audiofile called the soundscape.
The audio processing part of the project involves these steps:

1. **Voice Recording**: We record the voices of the audience members in the booth. These recordings are then processed and integrated into a soundscape.

2. **Sound Integration Script**: A script is used (in a DAW such as Audacity or Adobe Audition) to insert these voice recordings into a pre-existing soundscape at specific timestamps or cues.

## Synchronization

We use a sophisticated synchronization system to ensure all elements of the experience (images, sound, and interactivity) flow seamlessly(TBD).
